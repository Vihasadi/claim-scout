"""Token estimates, and fitting text into a prompt budget.

The estimate is deliberately simple and provider-neutral: about 3.5
characters per token for English business prose, rounded up. It is
conservative for most tokenizers, and `LLMConfig.prompt_budget` keeps
another 10% in reserve. Because the estimate is a pure function of length,
clipping can compute the exact cut in one step instead of measuring and
retrying.
